# Periodic Noise Cancellation Test Case
This test case demonstrates the changes in output with periodic noise input. This test case 
will test how analogRead output, with a change in number of samples recorded, is affected while 
there is periodic noise in the background

## Instructions
3. Upload the `periodicNoise.ino` sketch to your AVRDA board.
4. Using the noise generator, set the signal source to DC enable.
5. Enable periodic noise on the noise generator
6. Open a serial monitor to view the recorded readings.
